# Overview

- A learning experiment through LHL.
> A function that prints the next 5 appearances of the ISS


### Three API's are used:
- Fetch the IP [ipify API](https://www.ipify.org/)
- Fetch the Lat and Long [Ip whois](https://ipwhois.io/documentation)
- **deprecated** [iss fly over data](https://iss-pass.herokuapp.com/)
> __Must use__ https://iss-pass.herokuapp.com/json/?lat=YOUR_LAT_INPUT_HERE&lon=YOUR_LON_INPUT_HERE

### Notes
- I couldn't understand how to use the ``` new Date()``` object immediately and needed to reveal the answer for this. 
- I plan to follow up with a mentor.
